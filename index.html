              <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a 
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

              <p> “Before joining the bootcamp, I've
                never written a line of code, I needed
                some structure from professionals
                who can help me learn programming
                step by step. I was encouraged to
                enroll by a former student of theirs
                who can only say wonderful things
                about the program. The entire
                curriculum and staff did not
                disappoint. They were very hands-on
                and I never had to wait long for
                assistance. The agile team project, in
                particular, was outstanding. It took
                my learning to the next level in a way
                that no tutorial could ever have, in
                fact, I've often referred to it during
                interviews as an example of my
                developent experience. It certainly
                helped me land a job as a full-stack
                developer after receiving multiple
                offers, 100% recommend!”</p>
